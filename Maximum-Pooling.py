# Maximum Pooling

# Introduction
# In Lesson 2 we began our discussion of how the base in a convnet performs feature extraction. 
# We learned about how the first two operations in this process occur in a Conv2D layer with relu activation.

# In this lesson, we'll look at the third (and final) operation in this sequence: 
# condense with maximum pooling, which in Keras is done by a MaxPool2D layer.
