# Step 1: The Data Science of Shoelaces
# Nike has hired you as a data science consultant to help them save money on shoe materials. 
# Your first assignment is to review a model one of their employees built to predict how many shoelaces 
# they'll need each month. The features going into the machine learning model include:
# The current month (January, February, etc)
# Advertising expenditures in the previous month
# Various macroeconomic features (like the unemployment rate) as of the beginning of the current month
# The amount of leather they ended up using in the current month
# The results show the model is almost perfectly accurate if you include the feature about how much leather they used. 
# But it is only moderately accurate if you leave that feature out. 
# You realize this is because the amount of leather they use is a perfect indicator of how many shoes they produce, 
# which in turn tells you how many shoelaces they need.
# Do you think the leather used feature constitutes a source of data leakage? 
# If your answer is "it depends," what does it depend on?
# This is tricky, and it depends on details of how data is collected 
# (which is common when thinking about leakage). 
# Would you at the beginning of the month decide how much leather will be used that month? 
# If so, this is ok. But if that is determined during the month, 
# you would not have access to it when you make the prediction. 
# If you have a guess at the beginning of the month, and it is subsequently changed during the month, 
# the actual amount used during the month cannot be used as a feature (because it causes leakage).

# Step 2: Return of the Shoelaces
# You have a new idea. You could use the amount of leather Nike ordered (rather than the amount they actually used) 
# leading up to a given month as a predictor in your shoelace model.
# Does this change your answer about whether there is a leakage problem? 
# If you answer "it depends," what does it depend on?
# This could be fine, but it depends on whether they order shoelaces first or leather first. 
# If they order shoelaces first, you won't know how much leather they've ordered when you predict their shoelace needs. 
# If they order leather first, then you'll have that number available when you place your shoelace order, 
# and you should be ok.

# Step 3: Getting Rich With Cryptocurrencies?
# model predicts the price of a new cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin, but a newer one) 
# one day ahead of the moment of prediction.
# The most important features in his model are:
# Current price of the currency
# Amount of the currency sold in the last 24 hours
# Change in the currency price in the last 24 hours
# Change in the currency price in the last 1 hour
# Number of new tweets in the last 24 hours that mention the currency
# There is no source of leakage here. These features should be available at the moment you want to make a predition, 
# and they're unlikely to be changed in the training data after the prediction target is determined. 
# But, the way he describes accuracy could be misleading if you aren't careful. If the price moves gradually, 
# today's price will be an accurate predictor of tomorrow's price, 
# but it may not tell you whether it's a good time to invest. 
# For instance, if it is $100 today, a model predicting a price of $100 tomorrow may seem accurate, 
# even if it can't tell you whether the price is going up or down from the current price. 
# A better prediction target would be the change in price over the next day. 
# If you can consistently predict whether the price is about to go up or down (and by how much), 
# you may have a winning investment opportunity.

# Step 4: Preventing Infections
# An agency that provides healthcare wants to predict which patients from a rare surgery are at risk of infection, 
# so it can alert the nurses to be especially careful when following up with those patients.
# You want to build a model. Each row in the modeling dataset will be a single patient who received the surgery, 
# and the prediction target will be whether they got an infection.
# Some surgeons may do the procedure in a manner that raises or lowers the risk of infection. 
# But how can you best incorporate the surgeon information into the model?
# You have a clever idea.
# 1. Take all surgeries by each surgeon and calculate the infection rate among those surgeons.
# 2. For each patient in the data, find out who the surgeon was and plug in that surgeon's average infection rate 
#    as a feature.
# Does this pose any target leakage issues? Does it pose any train-test contamination issues?
# This poses a risk of both target leakage and train-test contamination 
# (though you may be able to avoid both if you are careful).
# You have target leakage if a given patient's outcome contributes to the infection rate for his surgeon, 
# which is then plugged back into the prediction model for whether that patient becomes infected. 
# You can avoid target leakage if you calculate the surgeon's infection rate by using only the surgeries before 
# the patient we are predicting for. Calculating this for each surgery in your training data may be a little tricky.
# You also have a train-test contamination problem if you calculate this using all surgeries a surgeon performed, 
# including those from the test-set. The result would be that your model could look very accurate on the test set, 
# even if it wouldn't generalize well to new patients after the model is deployed. 
# This would happen because the surgeon-risk feature accounts for data in the test set. 
# Test sets exist to estimate how the model will do when seeing new data. 
# So this contamination defeats the purpose of the test set.

# Step 5: Housing Prices
# You will build a model to predict housing prices. The model will be deployed on an ongoing basis, 
# to predict the price of a new house when a description is added to a website. 
# Here are four features that could be used as predictors.
# 1. Size of the house (in square meters)
# 2. Average sales price of homes in the same neighborhood
# 3. Latitude and longitude of the house
# 4. Whether the house has a basement
# You have historic data to train and validate the model.
# Which of the features is most likely to be a source of leakage?
# Fill in the line below with one of 1, 2, 3 or 4.
potential_leakage_feature = 2

# Check your answer
q_5.check()

# Correct:
# 2 is the source of target leakage. Here is an analysis for each feature:
# 1. The size of a house is unlikely to be changed after it is sold (though technically it's possible). 
#    But typically this will be available when we need to make a prediction, 
#    and the data won't be modified after the home is sold. So it is pretty safe.
# 2. We don't know the rules for when this is updated. If the field is updated in the raw data after a home was sold, 
#    and the home's sale is used to calculate the average, this constitutes a case of target leakage. 
#    At an extreme, if only one home is sold in the neighborhood, and it is the home we are trying to predict, 
#    then the average will be exactly equal to the value we are trying to predict. In general, 
#    for neighborhoods with few sales, the model will perform very well on the training data. 
#    But when you apply the model, the home you are predicting won't have been sold yet, 
#    so this feature won't work the same as it did in the training data.
# 3. These don't change, and will be available at the time we want to make a prediction. 
#    So there's no risk of target leakage here.
# 4. This also doesn't change, and it is available at the time we want to make a prediction. 
#    So there's no risk of target leakage here.
