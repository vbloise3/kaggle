# Exercise: Binary Classification

# Introduction
# In this exercise, you'll build a model to predict hotel cancellations with a binary classifier.
# Setup plotting

plt.rc('axes', labelweight='bold', labelsize='large',

# 1) Define Model
# The model we'll use this time will have both batch normalization and dropout layers. 
# To ease reading we've broken the diagram into blocks, but you can define it layer by layer as usual.

# Define a model with an architecture given by this diagram:
# See diagram  in https://www.kaggle.com/vbloise/exercise-binary-classification/edit
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# YOUR CODE HERE: define the model given in the diagram
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'), 
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'),
])

# Check your answer
q_1.check()

# 2) Add Optimizer, Loss, and Metric
# Now compile the model with the Adam optimizer and binary versions of the cross-entropy loss and accuracy metric.
# YOUR CODE HERE
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['binary_accuracy'],
)

# Check your answer
q_2.check()

# Finally, run this cell to train the model and view the learning curves. 
# It may run for around 60 to 70 epochs, which could take a minute or two.
early_stopping = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    patience=5,
    min_delta=0.001,
    restore_best_weights=True,
)
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
    batch_size=512,
    epochs=200,
    callbacks=[early_stopping],
)

history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
history_df.loc[:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot(title="Cross-entropy")
history_df.loc[:, ['binary_accuracy', 'val_binary_accuracy']].plot(title="Accuracy")

# 3) Train and Evaluate
# What do you think about the learning curves? Does it look like the model underfit or overfit? 
# Was the cross-entropy loss a good stand-in for accuracy?

# Though we can see the training loss continuing to fall, the early stopping callback prevented any overfitting. 
# Moreover, the accuracy rose at the same rate as the cross-entropy fell, so it appears that minimizing cross-entropy 
# was a good stand-in. All in all, it looks like this training was a success!
